		<h3>Binding</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Saddle Stitch</li>
		Saddle stitch is another name for stapler binding. For documents that have</br>
		less than 20 pages, saddle stitch is applicable. Any larger and the pages tend</br>
		to curve and additional cutting services are needed to straighten out the </br>
		pages.</br>
		</br>
		<li>Heated Spine</li>
		Pages will be heated with plastic that will cause it to adhere to the a ready-made </br>
		spine with cover. The sizes we have for the spine are from 10mm to 50mm. Documents with</br>
		larger spines will need wire stitching or else the risk of breaking the heated plastic </br>
		binding is greater.</br>
		</br>
		<li>Wire</li>
		Your document will first be perforated with holes and we will thread, by machine,</br>
		a wire binder. Wire binding is the most professional-looking, and also the most </br>
		expensive. The sizes we have for the spine are from 5mm to 100mm. As the spine gets </br>
		larger, the wires get thicker.</br>
