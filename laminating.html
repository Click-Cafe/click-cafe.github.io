		<div id="content">
		<p>There are times when you need your paper to become more durable so that it lasts</br>
		longer. This is especially true for documents that are handled a lot such as </br>
		portfolios. Laminating is simply sandwiching paper in-between two thin sheets of </br>
		clear plastic. The plastic is heated and protects the paper pages. Our laminating </br>
		machine can produce clear pages, or even textured ones.</br></p>
